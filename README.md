# Task_1
This godot project is a part of test task for "Atom" company.

Threre are 2 solutions what I have suggested. "Base" has minimal functions and code for task solving, "Alternative" is more complex. In "alternative" I suggested possible functions what can be useful and moved part of code from controller to object.

For user both projects works identical. Is a cube what move forward/backward with changable speed. Use keys "1", "2", "3" and "4" to change speed by default.

For changing keys, directions and move limits you can use exported variables of controller node (or borders node in alternative scene)
